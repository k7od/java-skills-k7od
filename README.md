# Java Skills - Idris

This project is a collection of basic Java programs to practice my Java programming skills.

## Structure
- `src/` folder contains all the Java source files.
- `compile.sh` is a simple script to compile the Java files.
- `.gitignore` is set up to ignore compiled files and IDE folders.
